//! Partial self and mutual inductances of rectangular filaments — the
//! numerical core of the PEEC method.
//!
//! For two straight filaments carrying uniform current densities along unit
//! vectors `l̂ᵢ`, `l̂ⱼ`, Ruehli's partial inductance is the Neumann integral
//! averaged over both cross-sections (Ruehli, *IBM J. Res. Dev.* 16 (1972);
//! Kamon, Tsuk & White, *IEEE T-MTT* 42 (1994), §III):
//!
//! ```text
//! Lᵢⱼ = μ0/(4π) · (l̂ᵢ·l̂ⱼ)/(AᵢAⱼ) · ∫_{Vᵢ} ∫_{Vⱼ} dV dV' / |r − r'|
//! ```
//!
//! # Methods
//!
//! [`mutual_inductance`] picks one of four evaluations of that integral;
//! [`mutual_inductance_detailed`] reports which one ([`Method`]).
//!
//! | Pair | Method |
//! |------|--------|
//! | orthogonal | exactly zero |
//! | separated by ≳ half a length | [`Method::PointQuadrature`]: adaptive-order Gauss–Legendre over all six dimensions, SIMD over the inner points |
//! | parallel, cross-section axes aligned (a filament with itself, its bundle neighbours, collinear or stacked segments) | [`Method::BarClosedForm`]: the exact 64-term Hoer–Love/Ruehli formula, when its rounding error is provably small; otherwise [`Method::AlignedQuadrature`]: exact in both lengths, singularity-aware quadrature over the cross-sections |
//! | anything else that is close | [`Method::SampledFilaments`]: exact Grover line-to-line formulas sampled over both cross-sections |
//!
//! The aligned-bar methods reach a relative accuracy of about `1e-9` and the
//! point quadrature about `1e-8`; see [`Method::SampledFilaments`] for the
//! last, and the crate's integration tests for the validation of every path
//! against independent numerical integration.
//!
//! # Validated range and limitations
//!
//! * Self and aligned-bar terms are validated against independent references
//!   for length : cross-section ratios from `0.2` to `1e7` and cross-section
//!   aspect ratios up to `1e4`, and exercised (finite, monotone, bounded by
//!   the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality) down to `1e-3`.
//! * Non-aligned bars that touch, overlap, or lie closer than about half a
//!   cross-section extent are flagged [`Mutual::resolved`]` == false`; on the
//!   bends and crossings of the test-suite they are within `1e-4` of a fine
//!   reference, and should be trusted to about `1e-3`.
//! * Filaments between `1e-6` and `1e-4` rad from parallel that are also
//!   close and not aligned lose accuracy as `1e-17/sin²ε` (to `1e-5` at
//!   `1e-6` rad); below `1e-6` rad they are treated as exactly parallel.
//! * Current density is uniform over each cross-section and directed along
//!   the filament — the PEEC assumption. Nothing here is frequency dependent.
//!
//! # Units
//!
//! SI throughout: metres in, henries out.
