//! Reader for the FastHenry `.inp` deck format — a public, documented file
//! format — restricted to the subset documented below.
//!
//! # Clean-room note
//!
//! The `.inp` deck format is a published file format, and a file format is
//! not code; this parser is written from the public format description and
//! from self-authored example decks only. No FastHenry or FastCap source,
//! text, or tables were consulted, in keeping with the repository's
//! clean-room rule (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
//!
//! # Supported subset
//!
//! | Line | Meaning |
//! |------|---------|
//! | `.units km\|m\|cm\|mm\|um\|in\|mils` | Length unit for every coordinate and dimension (`mil` also accepted) |
//! | `.default <field>=<v> …` | Defaults for later lines: `x`, `y`, `z`, `w`, `h`, `nwinc`, `nhinc`, `rw`, `rh`, `wx`, `wy`, `wz`, `sigma` or `rho` |
//! | `N<name> [x]=<v> [y]=<v> [z]=<v>` | Node; each coordinate falls back to its `.default` |
//! | `E<name> N<a> N<b> [field]=<v> …` | Segment between two nodes; fields as for `.default` minus `x`/`y`/`z`, plus `group=<name>` |
//! | `.external N<+> N<-> [name]` | A port: current in at `N<+>`, out at `N<->`, labelled `name` (extension; default `<+>/<->`) |
//! | `.freq fmin=<v> fmax=<v> ndec=<n>` | Frequency sweep in hertz (see below) |
//! | `G<name> x1=… y1=… z1=… x2=… y2=… z2=… x3=… y3=… z3=… thick=… seg1=… seg2=… [sigma=\|rho=] [nhinc=]` | Ground plane, FastHenry corner-point form (see below) |
//! | `G<name> x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 t [nx=] [ny=] [nhinc=] [sigma=\|rho=]` | Ground plane, extension form: extent, top surface `z`, thickness `t` down, `nx × ny` cells; conductivity falls back to `.default` |
//! | `.hole G<name> x1 y1 x2 y2` | Rectangular hole in that plane's footprint |
//! | `.contact G<name> x1 y1 x2 y2 [nx=] [ny=] [ratio=]` | Contact region: refine that rectangle to `nx × ny` cells, decaying outward by `ratio` |
//! | `.equiv N<a> N<b> [N<c> …]` | Electrically join two or more nodes into one |
//! | `.couples all \| <group> <group> …` | Which segment groups couple; default (no line) is all pairs |
//! | `.end` | End of deck (required) |
//!
//! Lines beginning with `*` are comments; a line beginning with `+`
//! continues the previous line. Directives are case-insensitive; node and
//! element names are case-sensitive alphanumeric tokens (`N1`, `Ea3`).
//! Conductivity is given either as `sigma=` or as its reciprocal, the
//! resistivity `rho=` (which must be positive); naming both on one line —
//! continuation lines included — is an error, while a per-line value in
//! either form overrides a `.default` in either form.
//!
//! Where this reader knowingly departs from the public format description —
//! `.title` as an explicit directive rather than an always-ignored first
//! line (unless [`ParseOptions::fasthenry_compat`] is set; see
//! [`parse_with_options`]), `.units` being mandatory, `.end` rejecting trailing content — the
//! reasoning is recorded field by field in
//! [`docs/fasthenry-compat.md`](https://github.com/2AMLogic/fasterhenry/blob/main/docs/fasthenry-compat.md),
//! alongside every directive this reader does and does not accept.
//!
//! # Ground planes: two `G` grammars
//!
//! A `G` statement may be written either way, and a deck may mix them; the
//! two are told apart by the shape of the first token after the name (a
//! bare number starts the extension form, `x1=…` the corner-point form),
//! never by a deck-wide mode. Both produce the same
//! [`fasterhenry::plane::GroundPlane`], so `.hole`, `.contact`, `.equiv`
//! and endpoint landing behave identically whichever form declared the
//! plane.
//!
//! ## FastHenry corner-point form
//!
//! ```text
//! G<name> x1=… y1=… z1=… x2=… y2=… z2=… x3=… y3=… z3=…
//! +       thick=… seg1=… seg2=… [sigma=…|rho=…] [nhinc=…]
//! +       N<name> (x, y, z) …
//! +       hole rect (x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2) …
//! +       hole point (x, y, z) …
//! +       hole circle (x, y, z, r) …
//! +       contact rect (x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2) …
//! +       contact decay_rect (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth, xcell, ycell, xmaxcell, ymaxcell) …
//! +       contact point (x, y, z, xcell, ycell) …
//! +       contact line (x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, xcell, ycell) …
//! +       contact equiv_rect N<name> (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth) …
//! +       contact connection N<name> (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth, ratio) …
//! ```
//!
//! * **The three corner points** give one corner and its two neighbours:
//!   `p1 → p2` is the first edge (cut into `seg1` cells), `p2 → p3` the
//!   second (`seg2` cells). This engine's plane is an axis-aligned
//!   rectangle parallel to the xy plane, so `z1 = z2 = z3` is required and
//!   each edge must run along x or y; a tilted or rotated plane is
//!   rejected by name rather than silently squared off.
//! * **`thick=`** is the thickness, and the corner points give the plane's
//!   **mid-thickness** surface — as a segment's nodes give its axis. The
//!   extension form instead names the **top** surface, so the same plane is
//!   `z1 = z_mid + thick/2` there.
//! * **`seg1`/`seg2`** become the background cell counts of this engine's
//!   cell-centre mesh (`nx`/`ny`). The mesh itself is this project's own
//!   PEEC discretization, not FastHenry's panel mesh (see the
//!   `fasterhenry::plane` module documentation), so equal cell counts mean
//!   equal resolution, not an identical node set.
//! * **`sigma=`** is per deck unit exactly as elsewhere, and so is its
//!   reciprocal **`rho=`**, which this form takes on the statement too;
//!   naming both on one statement — continuation lines included — is an
//!   error, and giving neither falls back to the `.default` conductivity
//!   (`.default sigma=` or `.default rho=`). **`nhinc=`** cuts every bar of
//!   the plane into that many filaments through the thickness.
//! * **`N<name> (x, y, z)`** declares an in-plane node. It is an ordinary
//!   deck node that belongs to this plane: reference it from a segment or
//!   `.external`, or join it to a segment node with `.equiv`, and the
//!   connection lands on the nearest live cell-centre node of *that* plane
//!   — whichever side `.equiv` named first. Joining in-plane nodes of two
//!   *different* planes is rejected (connect the planes with a segment).
//! * **`hole rect`** maps onto [`fasterhenry::plane::Hole::Rect`] and
//!   **`contact rect`** onto [`fasterhenry::plane::ContactRegion`] (2 × 2 fine cells
//!   at ratio 2 — use `.contact` to choose other values). The `z`
//!   coordinates are redundant for a plane parallel to xy, but are checked
//!   against the plane's own slab so a rectangle meant for another plane
//!   cannot land here silently.
//! * **`contact decay_rect`** maps onto a
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::ContactRegion`] too — the shape that states its
//!   own refinement rather than taking `contact rect`'s default. Its nine
//!   values are the rectangle's **centre** `(x, y, z)`, its **full
//!   widths** `xwidth`/`ywidth` about that centre, the largest cell wanted
//!   **inside** it (`xcell`/`ycell`) and the largest cell its outward
//!   decay may grow to (`xmaxcell`/`ymaxcell`, negative for no limit).
//!   Each axis is read on its own:
//!     * the fine cells are the fewest whose extent is no larger than that
//!       axis's `cell` — `ceil(width / cell)`, so 2 mm at `cell=1` is 2
//!       cells and at `cell=0.1` is 20;
//!     * the cells outside grow geometrically by `1/(1 − cell/width)` per
//!       cell, the documented decay law, until they reach the plane's
//!       background cell. `cell` must therefore be smaller than `width`
//!       (the ratio is otherwise not a ratio at all), and a `cell` equal
//!       to half the width is the familiar ratio 2;
//!     * a positive `maxcell` **finer** than the plane's own background
//!       cell is rejected by name: this engine's grading levels off *at*
//!       the background cell, so honouring a tighter limit would need a
//!       finer plane (raise `seg1`/`seg2`), not a quietly coarser mesh.
//!       A limit at or above the background cell never binds, and a
//!       negative one asks for none.
//!
//!   Note that `decay_rect` names its rectangle by **centre and widths**
//!   while this reader's `hole rect` / `contact rect` name **two opposite
//!   corners** — the same rectangle written two ways, so `contact
//!   decay_rect (5, 3, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, -1, -1)` and `contact rect (4, 2, 0,
//!   6, 4, 0)` are one region. (That `contact rect` takes corners at all
//!   is this reader's own choice, mirroring `hole rect`; issue #95 tracks
//!   reconciling it with the documented centre-and-widths form.)
//! * **`hole point (x, y, z)`** and **`hole circle (x, y, z, r)`** map onto
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::Hole::Point`] and
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::Hole::Circle`] (issue #98). A point removes
//!   exactly the one cell whose own extent — edges included — contains it;
//!   a point that lands exactly on a shared cell edge or corner is the
//!   documented tie, and removes every cell touching it rather than
//!   guessing a single winner. A circle removes every cell whose centre
//!   lies at or inside its radius `r` (a centre exactly on the circle is
//!   removed — a closed boundary, unlike `hole rect`'s open one). Both take
//!   the shape's own `z`, checked against the plane's slab like every other
//!   clause here.
//! * **`hole user1` … `user7`** are rejected by name, on the statement's
//!   own line, and that rejection is **permanent** — not a shape awaiting
//!   implementation (issue #99; the decision and its reasoning are in
//!   `docs/fasthenry-compat.md`). A user-defined hole is a generator
//!   compiled into the tool itself: the deck carries a shape name and a
//!   value list whose meaning is stated nowhere in the deck, so there is no
//!   geometry here to read, and no amount of plane-model work would let
//!   this reader read one. The error names two alternatives instead: the
//!   declarative shapes above, and — for a shape none of them describe —
//!   building the plane through the library, where
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::GroundPlane::mesh`] reports the exact cell
//!   centres the plane meshes to and a
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::Hole::Point`] at each centre an arbitrary rule
//!   selects removes precisely those cells.
//! * **`contact point (x, y, z, xcell, ycell)`** and **`contact line (x0,
//!   y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, xcell, ycell)`** (issue #100) ask that every cell
//!   holding the point, or crossed by the line, be no larger than `xcell`
//!   across x and `ycell` across y. Both map onto a
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::ContactRegion`]:
//!     * the region is the locus's bounding box padded by half a requested
//!       cell on every side, cut into the fewest cells no larger than that
//!       cell — so a point is exactly **one** `xcell × ycell` cell centred
//!       on it (a via landing there snaps onto that cell's centre), a line
//!       along x is a one-cell-high strip reaching half a cell past each
//!       end, and a zero-length line is the point at its ends;
//!     * outside, the cells grade back to the background at ratio 2, the
//!       same default `contact rect` and `.contact` use: neither shape
//!       documents a decay of its own, and a tensor-product mesh has to
//!       return to the background cell somehow;
//!     * a requested cell at or above the plane's background cell is
//!       already met there (grading never grows a cell past the
//!       background cell), so that axis is clamped to the background cell
//!       rather than coarsened, and a point or line met on both axes adds
//!       no region at all;
//!     * both ends are checked against the plane's slab and footprint, on
//!       the statement's own line.
//!
//!   A **diagonal** line refines its whole padded bounding box, not a
//!   band along the diagonal. That is the exact cost of this engine's
//!   tensor-product mesh rather than an approximation of the request: a
//!   refined band on one axis spans the plane on the other (see the
//!   `fasterhenry::plane` module documentation), so any refinement that
//!   covers the line — a chain of small rectangles along it included —
//!   produces these same x- and y-bands, and their crossing is the box. A
//!   line running `Lx` by `Ly` therefore costs about `(Lx/xcell) ·
//!   (Ly/ycell)` fine cells where a mesh free to follow it would need
//!   about `Lx/xcell + Ly/ycell`; an axis-aligned line costs nothing
//!   extra. The request itself is always honoured, overlapping regions
//!   included: merged bands keep their finest cell.
//! * **`contact equiv_rect N<name> (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth)`** declares a
//!   *contact area*: the rectangle — centre and full widths, as
//!   `decay_rect` spells it — is tied to one node, named here, so a deck
//!   can `.equiv` an external node onto a whole landing pad instead of a
//!   point (issue #101). It maps onto
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::Equipotential`]: every live cell centre inside
//!   the rectangle (its boundary included) shares a single node, the bars
//!   that ran between those cells are not built, and the bars crossing the
//!   patch's boundary end on that one node — see the
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane`] module documentation for exactly what the tie
//!   does to the mesh. The node itself is an ordinary deck node: name it
//!   from `.external`, from a segment, or join it with `.equiv`, and the
//!   whole joined set lands on the patch (an `.equiv` set holding both a
//!   contact area and a plain in-plane node of the same plane lands on the
//!   *area* — attaching to the nearest single cell instead would throw away
//!   the very thing the clause declared). Its name follows the same rule as
//!   an in-plane node's — it starts with `N` — and a rectangle catching no
//!   live cell centre is an error naming the plane, not a silent landing on
//!   a neighbouring cell.
//! * **`contact connection N<name> (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth, ratio)`** is
//!   the documented shorthand for that same rectangle tied *and* refined:
//!   exactly a `contact equiv_rect` over it plus a `contact decay_rect`
//!   whose cells are `xwidth/ratio` and `ywidth/ratio` with no decay limit
//!   (issue #101). `ratio` must be greater than 1 — it is what the widths
//!   are divided by, so 1 or less asks for a cell as wide as the rectangle
//!   and grades nothing. Writing the two clauses out by hand gives exactly
//!   the same deck; the pairing matters because a tie is only as good as the
//!   mesh under it, and the `decay_rect` is what puts cells inside the
//!   rectangle for it to tie.
//! * Every other documented shape is **rejected by name** too, on the
//!   statement's own line: this engine's holes are rectangles, points or
//!   circles and its contacts rectangles, points, lines or tied areas, and
//!   a shape whose semantics have not been stated and tested must not be
//!   quietly approximated by one of those. Unlike the user-defined holes,
//!   these have a public meaning, and each is rejected for its own stated
//!   reason:
//!     * `contact circle` — issue #109 (its argument list still to be
//!       pinned from the public documentation);
//!     * `contact trace` — issue #110 (how `trace_width` and
//!       `scale_factor` set the cell size still to be pinned);
//!     * `contact initial_grid (rows, cols)` and
//!       `contact initial_mesh_grid (rows, cols)` need **no** model change:
//!       `seg1`/`seg2` already say what the first says, and a checkerboard
//!       of `hole point` clauses at the centres
//!       [`fasterhenry::plane::GroundPlane::mesh`] reports says what the
//!       second adds. What is missing is the one fact the value list turns
//!       on — which of `(rows, cols)` counts the `p1 → p2` edge — and a
//!       transposed guess would silently mesh every non-square plane the
//!       wrong way round, so the error names `seg1`/`seg2` instead of
//!       guessing (issue #113; the clean-room rule in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
//!       forbids guessing an undocumented argument order).
//! * The remaining documented plane parameters are rejected by name too,
//!   each with the reason and the alternative: `rh` (plane filaments are
//!   uniform), `segwid1`/`segwid2` (bar widths follow
//!   the cells), `relx`/`rely`/`relz` (name the in-plane nodes instead),
//!   and `file` (an output option this engine does not have). Nothing on a
//!   `G` statement is silently ignored.
//!
//! # Semantics
//!
//! * **Units are mandatory.** A deck without an explicit `.units` line is
//!   rejected rather than silently assuming a default, so a missing unit can
//!   never scale a result by a factor of 10 or 100. The unit is
//!   case-insensitive: `km` (10³ m), `m`, `cm`, `mm`, `um` (10⁻⁶ m), `in`
//!   (0.0254 m) or `mils` (10⁻³ in; `mil` is a synonym). Lengths
//!   (coordinates, `w`, `h`) scale with the unit; **conductivity and
//!   resistivity are per deck unit** — `sigma=5.8e4` under `.units mm` is
//!   copper (5.8e4 S/mm = 5.8e7 S/m), and so is `rho=1.7241e-5`
//!   (Ω·mm = 1.7241e-8 Ω·m). `rho=r` is exactly `sigma=1/r`.
//! * **`nwinc`/`nhinc` and `rw`/`rh` cut the cross-section into
//!   filaments.** `nwinc` filaments go across the width and `nhinc` across
//!   the height (default 1 each). `rw` and `rh` are the ratio of adjacent
//!   filament extents along the width and the height respectively, each
//!   axis independently: every filament is `rw` (or `rh`) times as wide
//!   (or high) as its neighbour one step nearer the conductor surface, so
//!   the thinnest filaments line both surfaces and the fattest fill the
//!   core — `nwinc=5 rw=2` cuts the width in the proportions 1:2:4:2:1, and
//!   `nwinc=4 rw=3` in 1:3:3:1. This is the library's graded
//!   discretization (`fasterhenry::discretize_graded_per_axis`), per
//!   segment. A ratio must be at least 1 (1 is a uniform axis; a ratio
//!   below 1, coarsening *toward* the surface, is rejected rather than
//!   guessed at), and it has no effect on an axis with a single filament.
//!   **An omitted ratio means a uniform axis** (ratio 1): this reader's
//!   long-standing behaviour, kept so that a deck without `rw`/`rh` solves
//!   exactly as before. Set `rw`/`rh` explicitly (on the segment or in
//!   `.default`) to request a graded grid.
//! * **`wx`/`wy`/`wz` orient the cross-section.** Together they are a
//!   vector along the segment's *width* (dimensionless: it is not scaled by
//!   `.units`, and need be neither normalized nor exactly perpendicular to
//!   the segment — only its component perpendicular to the centreline
//!   counts). The height then runs along `length × width`. As soon as one
//!   component is given (on the segment or in `.default`), the vector is
//!   explicit and any component given nowhere is 0; each component falls
//!   back to its own `.default`. A zero vector, or one parallel to the
//!   segment, fixes no orientation and is an error on the `E` line. Without
//!   any of the three, the default rule applies: the width lies in the x–y
//!   plane, perpendicular to the segment (`+x` for a segment along z) —
//!   see `fasterhenry::Segment::basis`.
//! * **`.freq fmin fmax ndec`** samples `ndec` points per decade,
//!   log-spaced: `f(k) = fmin · 10^(k/ndec)` for `k = 0 … n−1`, with
//!   `n = floor(ndec · log10(fmax/fmin)) + 1`; `fmin` is always the first
//!   point and `fmax` is reached when the decades divide evenly.
//!   `fmin = fmax` (any `ndec`) is the single-frequency case; `fmin = 0` is
//!   allowed only there (the DC solve).
//! * **`.equiv a b …`** makes every later name an alias of `a`: every
//!   reference — declared before or after the directive — resolves to `a`,
//!   and the aliased nodes do not appear in the resulting geometry. One
//!   exception to "the first name wins": if any node in the joined set is an
//!   in-plane node, the whole set lands on that plane (see above), because
//!   joining a via's node to a plane node is what wires a deck into a plane
//!   and the result must not depend on the argument order.
//! * **`.couples` truncates, and defaults to truncating nothing.** Without a
//!   `.couples` line — and with `.couples all` — every pair of conductors is
//!   coupled, exactly as before. A `.couples g1 g2 …` line switches the deck
//!   into truncating mode and declares the listed groups mutually coupled (a
//!   clique: every listed group with every other). Every other pair of groups
//!   has its mutual inductance dropped without ever being computed. Segments
//!   take their group from `group=<name>` on the `E` line (case-sensitive,
//!   like node names); untagged segments and ground planes share one default
//!   group. Naming a group no segment carries is an error, not a no-op.
//!   Truncation is a physical approximation — see the `fasterhenry::coupling`
//!   module documentation for when it is safe; groups closer than their own
//!   extent are reported on stderr.
//! * **Planes connect by landing**: a segment or port endpoint that lies
//!   within a plane's footprint and depth is snapped to the nearest live
//!   cell-centre node, wiring the segment into the plane mesh. Declare the
//!   plane before or after the segment — the assembly is order-independent.
//!   A landing that is a *pad* rather than a point is a contact **area**
//!   instead: `contact equiv_rect` (or its `contact connection` shorthand)
//!   names a rectangle of the plane, ties every cell inside it to one node,
//!   and lets the deck land on that (see the corner-point form above).
//! * **`.contact` grades the mesh under a landing.** A plane's `nx`/`ny`
//!   are its *background* resolution; every `.contact` rectangle is cut
//!   into `nx × ny` fine cells of its own (default `2 × 2`) and the cells
//!   outside it grow by `ratio` each (default `2`, `1` meaning no decay)
//!   until they reach the background cell. Put one under each via landing
//!   to resolve the current crowding there without paying for a fine mesh
//!   across the whole plane; grading is per axis, so a region refines a
//!   band across the plane in each direction (see the
//!   `fasterhenry::plane` module documentation for the cell-count
//!   formula). `.hole` and `.contact` both name a plane declared earlier
//!   in the deck, with the leading `G` optional.
//! * Everything else is rejected with an error carrying the line number.
//!   Deck-level problems that belong to no single line (missing `.units`, a
//!   ground-plane assembly failure) report line 0; a segment the geometry
//!   rejects is reported on its own `E` line.
