//! Reader for the FastHenry `.inp` deck format — a public, documented file
//! format — restricted to the subset documented below.
//!
//! # Clean-room note
//!
//! The `.inp` deck format is a published file format, and a file format is
//! not code; this parser is written from the public format description and
//! from self-authored example decks only. No FastHenry or FastCap source,
//! text, or tables were consulted, in keeping with the repository's
//! clean-room rule (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
//!
//! # Supported subset
//!
//! | Line | Meaning |
//! |------|---------|
//! | `.units km\|m\|cm\|mm\|um\|in\|mils` | Length unit for every coordinate and dimension (`mil` also accepted) |
//! | `.default <field>=<v> …` | Defaults for later lines: `x`, `y`, `z`, `w`, `h`, `nwinc`, `nhinc`, `rw`, `rh`, `wx`, `wy`, `wz`, `sigma` or `rho` |
//! | `N<name> [x]=<v> [y]=<v> [z]=<v>` | Node; each coordinate falls back to its `.default` |
//! | `E<name> N<a> N<b> [field]=<v> …` | Segment between two nodes; fields as for `.default` minus `x`/`y`/`z`, plus `group=<name>` |
//! | `.external N<+> N<-> [name]` | A port: current in at `N<+>`, out at `N<->`, labelled `name` (extension; default `<+>/<->`) |
//! | `.freq fmin=<v> fmax=<v> ndec=<n>` | Frequency sweep in hertz (see below) |
//! | `G<name> x1=… y1=… z1=… x2=… y2=… z2=… x3=… y3=… z3=… thick=… seg1=… seg2=… [sigma=\|rho=] [nhinc=]` | Ground plane, FastHenry corner-point form (see below) |
//! | `G<name> x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 t [nx=] [ny=] [nhinc=] [sigma=\|rho=]` | Ground plane, extension form: extent, top surface `z`, thickness `t` down, `nx × ny` cells; conductivity falls back to `.default` |
//! | `.hole G<name> x1 y1 x2 y2` | Rectangular hole in that plane's footprint |
//! | `.contact G<name> x1 y1 x2 y2 [nx=] [ny=] [ratio=]` | Contact region: refine that rectangle to `nx × ny` cells, decaying outward by `ratio` |
//! | `.equiv N<a> N<b> [N<c> …]` | Electrically join two or more nodes into one |
//! | `.couples all \| <group> <group> …` | Which segment groups couple; default (no line) is all pairs |
//! | `.end` | End of deck (required) |
//!
//! Lines beginning with `*` are comments; a line beginning with `+`
//! continues the previous line. Directives are case-insensitive, and so are
//! node names (`N1`, `n1`), wherever they appear — node and in-plane node
//! declarations, segment endpoints, `.external` and `.equiv` (issue #156;
//! see the `# Semantics` section).
//! Whitespace around `=` is insignificant: `x = 1`, `x= 1` and `x =1` read
//! as `x=1` (a dangling `x=` with no value is still an error).
//! Conductivity is given either as `sigma=` or as its reciprocal, the
//! resistivity `rho=` (which must be positive); naming both on one line —
//! continuation lines included — is an error, while a per-line value in
//! either form overrides a `.default` in either form. A segment or plane
//! with no conductivity from its line or `.default` is an error, unless
//! [`ParseOptions::fasthenry_compat`] is set: then it is copper, 5.8e7 S/m
//! *physical* (independent of `.units`), with a [`ParseWarning`].
//!
//! Where this reader knowingly departs from the public format description —
//! `.title` as an explicit directive rather than an always-ignored first
//! line (unless [`ParseOptions::fasthenry_compat`] is set; see
//! [`parse_with_options`]), `.units` being mandatory, `.end` rejecting trailing content — the
//! reasoning is recorded field by field in
//! [`docs/fasthenry-compat.md`](https://github.com/2AMLogic/fasterhenry/blob/main/docs/fasthenry-compat.md),
//! alongside every directive this reader does and does not accept.
//!
//! # Ground planes: two `G` grammars
//!
//! A `G` statement may be written either way, and a deck may mix them; the
//! two are told apart by the shape of the first token after the name (a
//! bare number starts the extension form, `x1=…` the corner-point form),
//! never by a deck-wide mode. Both produce the same
//! [`fasterhenry::plane::GroundPlane`], so `.hole`, `.contact`, `.equiv`
//! and endpoint landing behave identically whichever form declared the
//! plane.
//!
//! ## FastHenry corner-point form
//!
//! ```text
//! G<name> x1=… y1=… z1=… x2=… y2=… z2=… x3=… y3=… z3=…
//! +       thick=… seg1=… seg2=… [sigma=…|rho=…] [nhinc=…]
//! +       N<name> (x, y, z) …
//! +       hole rect (x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2) …
//! +       hole point (x, y, z) …
//! +       hole circle (x, y, z, r) …
//! +       contact rect (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth, xcell, ycell) …
//! +       contact rect (x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2) …
//! +       contact decay_rect (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth, xcell, ycell, xmaxcell, ymaxcell) …
//! +       contact point (x, y, z, xcell, ycell) …
//! +       contact line (x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, xcell, ycell) …
//! +       contact equiv_rect N<name> (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth) …
//! +       contact connection N<name> (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth, ratio) …
//! ```
//!
//! * **The three corner points** give one corner and its two neighbours:
//!   `p1 → p2` is the first edge (cut into `seg1` cells), `p2 → p3` the
//!   second (`seg2` cells). This engine's plane is an axis-aligned
//!   rectangle parallel to the xy plane, so `z1 = z2 = z3` is required and
//!   each edge must run along x or y; a tilted or rotated plane is
//!   rejected by name rather than silently squared off.
//! * **`thick=`** is the thickness, and the corner points give the plane's
//!   **mid-thickness** surface — as a segment's nodes give its axis. The
//!   extension form instead names the **top** surface, so the same plane is
//!   `z1 = z_mid + thick/2` there.
//! * **`seg1`/`seg2`** become the background cell counts of this engine's
//!   cell-centre mesh (`nx`/`ny`). The mesh itself is this project's own
//!   PEEC discretization, not FastHenry's panel mesh (see the
//!   `fasterhenry::plane` module documentation), so equal cell counts mean
//!   equal resolution, not an identical node set. The `contact
//!   initial_grid` / `contact initial_mesh_grid` clauses below set this
//!   same pair, and a statement giving both is an error.
//! * **The plane's own coordinate system.** `p1` is its origin, the vector
//!   `p1 → p2` its x-direction and `p2 → p3` its y-direction — the frame the
//!   public description defines for a corner-point plane, and the frame it
//!   then states the `contact` clauses' cell sizes in. So every `x…`/`y…`
//!   pair of *lengths* in the clauses below is read along those two edges
//!   rather than along global x and y: `contact point`'s and `contact
//!   line`'s `xcell`/`ycell`, `contact decay_rect`'s `xwidth`/`ywidth`,
//!   `xcell`/`ycell` and `xmaxcell`/`ymaxcell`, `contact equiv_rect`'s and
//!   `contact connection`'s `xwidth`/`ywidth`, and — as its own entry below
//!   already says — `contact initial_grid`'s two counts. On a plane whose
//!   `p1 → p2` edge runs along global **y**, `xcell` is therefore the cell
//!   size across global y, and an anisotropic request is not transposed
//!   (issue #118; `docs/fasthenry-compat.md` records the evidence). It is
//!   the same convention `seg1`/`seg2` already follow, and for the usual
//!   plane — `p1 → p2` along global x, as every public example writes it —
//!   the two readings coincide.
//!
//!   **Coordinates are not relative.** Every `(x, y, z)` in the statement's
//!   body — in-plane nodes, holes, and the contact clauses' points, ends and
//!   rectangle centres — is an ordinary global deck coordinate, checked
//!   against this plane's footprint and slab. `p1` is the origin of a frame
//!   used for *directions* and for the `initial_mesh_grid` cell numbering,
//!   not an offset to add.
//! * **`sigma=`** is per deck unit exactly as elsewhere, and so is its
//!   reciprocal **`rho=`**, which this form takes on the statement too;
//!   naming both on one statement — continuation lines included — is an
//!   error, and giving neither falls back to the `.default` conductivity
//!   (`.default sigma=` or `.default rho=`). **`nhinc=`** cuts every bar of
//!   the plane into that many filaments through the thickness.
//! * **`N<name> (x, y, z)`** declares an in-plane node. It is an ordinary
//!   deck node that belongs to this plane: reference it from a segment or
//!   `.external`, or join it to a segment node with `.equiv`, and the
//!   connection lands on the nearest live cell-centre node of *that* plane
//!   — whichever side `.equiv` named first. Joining in-plane nodes of two
//!   *different* planes is rejected (connect the planes with a segment).
//! * **`hole rect (x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)`** takes **two opposite
//!   corners** and maps onto [`fasterhenry::plane::Hole::Rect`]. The `z`
//!   coordinates are redundant for a plane parallel to xy, but are checked
//!   against the plane's own slab so a rectangle meant for another plane
//!   cannot land here silently — as they are for every `hole` / `contact`
//!   clause below.
//! * **`contact rect`** maps onto [`fasterhenry::plane::ContactRegion`],
//!   and is read in **either of two spellings, told apart by value count**
//!   (issue #95; the decision and its reasoning are in
//!   `docs/fasthenry-compat.md`):
//!     * **seven values**, `(x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth, xcell, ycell)` — the
//!       documented form, and the same centre-and-widths shape of argument
//!       list `contact point`, `contact line`, `contact decay_rect` and
//!       `contact equiv_rect` use: the rectangle's **centre**, its **full
//!       widths** about that centre, and the largest cell wanted
//!       **inside** it. It is exactly `contact decay_rect` without the
//!       outward limits, so it is read as one with both `maxcell`s at the
//!       "no limit" sentinel — every rule in the `decay_rect` bullet below
//!       (the per-axis cell count, the documented decay law, `cell` smaller
//!       than `width`) holds here too;
//!     * **six values**, `(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)` — two opposite corners
//!       as `hole rect` spells them, this reader's own extension, refined
//!       to 2 × 2 fine cells at ratio 2 (use the seven-value form, or
//!       `.contact`, to choose other values).
//!
//!   The two are one clause, not two: the seven-value form at `xcell =
//!   xwidth/2`, `ycell = ywidth/2` is ratio 2 over 2 × 2 cells, so
//!   `contact rect (5, 3, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1)` and `contact rect (4, 2, 0, 6,
//!   4, 0)` are the same region. Any other value count is a line-numbered
//!   error naming both spellings.
//! * **`contact decay_rect`** maps onto a
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::ContactRegion`] too — the shape that bounds how
//!   coarse its outward decay may grow, which no other contact shape
//!   states. Its nine
//!   values are the rectangle's **centre** `(x, y, z)`, its **full
//!   widths** `xwidth`/`ywidth` about that centre, the largest cell wanted
//!   **inside** it (`xcell`/`ycell`) and the largest cell its outward
//!   decay may grow to (`xmaxcell`/`ymaxcell`, negative for no limit). All
//!   three pairs run along the plane's own axes (`p1 → p2` first), as above.
//!   Each axis is read on its own:
//!     * the fine cells are the fewest whose extent is no larger than that
//!       axis's `cell` — `ceil(width / cell)`, so 2 mm at `cell=1` is 2
//!       cells and at `cell=0.1` is 20;
//!     * the cells outside grow geometrically by `1/(1 − cell/width)` per
//!       cell, the documented decay law, until they reach the plane's
//!       background cell. `cell` must therefore be smaller than `width`
//!       (the ratio is otherwise not a ratio at all), and a `cell` equal
//!       to half the width is the familiar ratio 2;
//!     * a positive `maxcell` **finer** than the plane's own background
//!       cell is rejected by name: this engine's grading levels off *at*
//!       the background cell, so honouring a tighter limit would need a
//!       finer plane (raise `seg1`/`seg2`), not a quietly coarser mesh.
//!       A limit at or above the background cell never binds, and a
//!       negative one asks for none.
//!
//!   `decay_rect` differs from the seven-value `contact rect` above in
//!   exactly its last two values, the outward limits: `contact decay_rect
//!   (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth, xcell, ycell, -1, -1)` *is* `contact rect
//!   (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth, xcell, ycell)`. Only `hole rect` (and
//!   `contact rect`'s six-value extension) names a rectangle by **two
//!   opposite corners** — the same rectangle written the other way, so
//!   `contact decay_rect (5, 3, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, -1, -1)` and `contact rect
//!   (4, 2, 0, 6, 4, 0)` are one region.
//! * **`hole point (x, y, z)`** and **`hole circle (x, y, z, r)`** map onto
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::Hole::Point`] and
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::Hole::Circle`] (issue #98). A point removes
//!   exactly the one cell whose own extent — edges included — contains it;
//!   a point that lands exactly on a shared cell edge or corner is the
//!   documented tie, and removes every cell touching it rather than
//!   guessing a single winner. A circle removes every cell whose centre
//!   lies at or inside its radius `r` (a centre exactly on the circle is
//!   removed — a closed boundary, unlike `hole rect`'s open one). Both take
//!   the shape's own `z`, checked against the plane's slab like every other
//!   clause here.
//! * **A hole or contact rectangle wholly off the plane is accepted with a
//!   warning** (issue #105; the decision and its reasoning are in
//!   `docs/fasthenry-compat.md`). Its `z` is checked against the slab as
//!   above, but its **xy** is only tested for intersection with the plane's
//!   *closed* footprint, and a clause that misses it entirely raises one
//!   [`ParseWarning`] naming the clause, the plane and the clause's own
//!   physical (continuation) line:
//!     * `hole point` — the point is outside the footprint;
//!     * `hole circle` — the closed disc does not reach the footprint at
//!       all (a centre off the plane whose radius still reaches over an
//!       edge or corner is fine);
//!     * `hole rect`, `contact rect` (either spelling) and `contact
//!       decay_rect` — the rectangle does not intersect the footprint
//!       (partial overhang, or merely touching the boundary, is fine).
//!
//!   A hole like that removes nothing, exactly as before; a contact region
//!   like that refines nothing and is dropped rather than handed to the
//!   plane library, which rejects a region off the plane. The warning is
//!   only about *disjointness*: an in-footprint clause that happens to
//!   change nothing (a circle between cell centres, a hole inside another
//!   hole, a contact the background mesh already meets) raises none. The
//!   stricter clauses keep their errors — `contact point` / `line` /
//!   `trace` ends off the plane, and a `contact equiv_rect` or `contact
//!   connection` whose node is off the plane or that covers no live cell
//!   (so a `contact connection`'s decay half never reaches the warning).
//!   [`parse`] and [`parse_with_options`] discard warnings;
//!   [`parse_reporting`] and [`parse_with_options_reporting`] return them,
//!   and this module never prints one.
//! * **`hole user1` … `user7`** are rejected by name, on the statement's
//!   own line, and that rejection is **permanent** — not a shape awaiting
//!   implementation (issue #99; the decision and its reasoning are in
//!   `docs/fasthenry-compat.md`). A user-defined hole is a generator
//!   compiled into the tool itself: the deck carries a shape name and a
//!   value list whose meaning is stated nowhere in the deck, so there is no
//!   geometry here to read, and no amount of plane-model work would let
//!   this reader read one. The error names two alternatives instead: the
//!   declarative shapes above, and — for a shape none of them describe —
//!   building the plane through the library, where
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::GroundPlane::mesh`] reports the exact cell
//!   centres the plane meshes to and a
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::Hole::Point`] at each centre an arbitrary rule
//!   selects removes precisely those cells.
//! * **`contact point (x, y, z, xcell, ycell)`** and **`contact line (x0,
//!   y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, xcell, ycell)`** (issue #100) ask that every cell
//!   holding the point, or crossed by the line, be no larger than `xcell`
//!   along the plane's first edge and `ycell` along its second (the plane's
//!   own coordinate system, as above). Both map onto a
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::ContactRegion`]:
//!     * the region is the locus's bounding box padded by half a requested
//!       cell on every side, cut into the fewest cells no larger than that
//!       cell — so a point is exactly **one** `xcell × ycell` cell centred
//!       on it (a via landing there snaps onto that cell's centre), a line
//!       along x is a one-cell-high strip reaching half a cell past each
//!       end, and a zero-length line is the point at its ends;
//!     * outside, the cells grade back to the background at ratio 2, the
//!       same default the six-value `contact rect` and `.contact` use:
//!       neither shape documents a decay of its own, and a tensor-product
//!       mesh has to return to the background cell somehow;
//!     * a requested cell at or above the plane's background cell is
//!       already met there (grading never grows a cell past the
//!       background cell), so that axis is clamped to the background cell
//!       rather than coarsened — and clamped means *untouched*: the band
//!       spans the whole plane on that axis at the plane's own cell
//!       count, so its edges are the background mesh's own whether or not
//!       the request's coordinate lands on a background grid line. A
//!       point or line met on both axes adds no region at all;
//!     * both ends are checked against the plane's slab and footprint, on
//!       the statement's own line.
//!
//!   A **diagonal** line refines its whole padded bounding box, not a
//!   band along the diagonal. That is the exact cost of this engine's
//!   tensor-product mesh rather than an approximation of the request: a
//!   refined band on one axis spans the plane on the other (see the
//!   `fasterhenry::plane` module documentation), so any refinement that
//!   covers the line — a chain of small rectangles along it included —
//!   produces these same x- and y-bands, and their crossing is the box. A
//!   line running `Lx` by `Ly` therefore costs about `(Lx/xcell) ·
//!   (Ly/ycell)` fine cells where a mesh free to follow it would need
//!   about `Lx/xcell + Ly/ycell`; an axis-aligned line costs nothing
//!   extra. The request itself is always honoured, overlapping regions
//!   included: merged bands keep their finest cell.
//! * **`contact trace (x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, trace_width,
//!   scale_factor)`** (issue #110) refines the plane under a trace whose
//!   *projection* onto the plane runs from `(x0, y0)` to `(x1, y1)` —
//!   finely across the trace, not along it. Source: the public memo
//!   *Nonuniformly Discretized Reference Planes in FastHenry 3.0* (M.
//!   Kamon, 10 October 1996, section "Grouped contact utilities"), which
//!   describes the utility as a handful of `contact line` refinements
//!   keeping the cells under the trace no bigger than `trace_width/2`
//!   across it and the cells beside it no bigger than `trace_width`, and
//!   spells the lines out in a worked example along x. For a trace of length `L` and width `w` along
//!   x, it is exactly these five `contact line`s (along y, the same with
//!   the axes swapped):
//!     * at `y`, `y + w/2` and `y − w/2`, cells `(L, w/2)`;
//!     * at `y + 3w/2` and `y − 3w/2`, cells `(L, w)`.
//!
//!   The along-trace cell is the trace's own length, so once that reaches
//!   the background cell the trace adds no refinement along itself; each
//!   line then maps onto a region exactly as `contact line` does above
//!   (clamping included). The memo states that `scale_factor` has no
//!   effect on a trace parallel to x or y, so here it is only checked to
//!   be positive. The clause carries no `x…`/`y…` pair of its own — one
//!   `trace_width`, and a direction taken from its ends — and its expansion
//!   is symmetric in the two axes, so the plane-coordinate convention above
//!   leaves it alone: rotating the plane rotates the trace with it
//!   (issue #118). Both ends are checked against the plane's slab and
//!   footprint on the statement's own line; the side lines are not — the
//!   deck named the trace, not them — so beside a trace along the plane's
//!   edge they are clipped to the plane (or dropped, where they miss it)
//!   instead. A zero-length trace has no direction to refine across and is
//!   an error naming `contact point` instead.
//!
//!   A trace **not parallel to x or y** is, under `--fasthenry-compat`
//!   only, approximated (issue #157): its bounding box, padded by `3w/2` on
//!   every side, is refined like a `contact rect` with cells
//!   `(w/2)·scale_factor^min(|tan θ|, |cot θ|)` (θ in the plane's frame, so
//!   30° and 60° mirror each other), with a line-numbered warning that this
//!   approximates FastHenry's staircase refinement. Natively it is rejected
//!   by name, on the statement's own line, and the rejection is a decision
//!   rather than deferred work (see `docs/fasthenry-compat.md`, "Decision: a diagonal
//!   `contact trace` is rejected"): the same memo says the cells under a
//!   diagonal trace are magnified by `scale_factor^|tan θ|` (θ from the x
//!   axis) and, a paragraph earlier, that the magnification runs from 1 to
//!   `scale_factor` as θ goes from 90° to 45° — which disagree for every
//!   angle past 45° — and it never says where a diagonal trace's side
//!   lines go or what along-trace cell its lines ask for. The error names
//!   `contact line` instead, with which a deck states the cell outright.
//! * **`contact equiv_rect N<name> (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth)`** declares a
//!   *contact area*: the rectangle — centre and full widths, as
//!   `decay_rect` spells it, and like `decay_rect`'s widths measured along
//!   the plane's own axes — is tied to one node, named here, so a deck
//!   can `.equiv` an external node onto a whole landing pad instead of a
//!   point (issue #101). It maps onto
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::Equipotential`]: every live cell centre inside
//!   the rectangle (its boundary included) shares a single node, the bars
//!   that ran between those cells are not built, and the bars crossing the
//!   patch's boundary end on that one node — see the
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane`] module documentation for exactly what the tie
//!   does to the mesh. The node itself is an ordinary deck node: name it
//!   from `.external`, from a segment, or join it with `.equiv`, and the
//!   whole joined set lands on the patch (an `.equiv` set holding both a
//!   contact area and a plain in-plane node of the same plane lands on the
//!   *area* — attaching to the nearest single cell instead would throw away
//!   the very thing the clause declared). Its name follows the same rule as
//!   an in-plane node's — it starts with `N` — and a rectangle catching no
//!   live cell centre is an error naming the plane, not a silent landing on
//!   a neighbouring cell.
//! * **`contact connection N<name> (x, y, z, xwidth, ywidth, ratio)`** is
//!   the documented shorthand for that same rectangle tied *and* refined:
//!   exactly a `contact equiv_rect` over it plus a `contact decay_rect`
//!   whose cells are `xwidth/ratio` and `ywidth/ratio` with no decay limit
//!   (issue #101). `ratio` must be greater than 1 — it is what the widths
//!   are divided by, so 1 or less asks for a cell as wide as the rectangle
//!   and grades nothing. Writing the two clauses out by hand gives exactly
//!   the same deck; the pairing matters because a tie is only as good as the
//!   mesh under it, and the `decay_rect` is what puts cells inside the
//!   rectangle for it to tie.
//! * **`contact initial_grid (n1, n2)`** sets the plane's *initial*
//!   discretization, and it is the statement `seg1`/`seg2` already make:
//!   `n1` cells along `p1 → p2` and `n2` along `p2 → p3` (issue #113). That
//!   is the equivalence the clause's public description states outright —
//!   `seg1=10 seg2=12` may be replaced by `contact initial_grid (10,12)` —
//!   and the same description's worked example only comes out square-celled
//!   read that way, so the reader maps it rather than guessing: a
//!   transposition would silently mesh every non-square plane the wrong way
//!   round. Because the two clauses say the same thing, a statement giving
//!   both is a line-numbered error rather than a race between them. The
//!   description also calls `n1` a count of *rows*; `docs/fasthenry-compat.md`
//!   records why that word does not overturn the mapping.
//! * **`contact initial_mesh_grid (n1, n2)`** is that same initial grid with
//!   the documented checkerboard of holes punched into it: "every cell that
//!   has an even value for both of its indices where the numbering is from
//!   the top left" — so, with the cells numbered from 1 at the plane's own
//!   origin (its `p1` corner) along each axis, every cell whose two indices
//!   are both even. Each such cell is cut by a
//!   [`fasterhenry::plane::Hole::Rect`] over the cell's own rectangle: on
//!   the initial grid that is the same cut a `hole point` at the centre
//!   makes, but the grid is *initial*, and a later `contact` clause may
//!   refine that region — the documented hole is the whole square, not
//!   whichever smaller cell the refinement leaves under the centre. An axis
//!   with a single cell has no even index and so no hole.
//! * Every other documented shape is **rejected by name** too, on the
//!   statement's own line: this engine's holes are rectangles, points or
//!   circles and its contacts rectangles, points, lines, axis-aligned
//!   traces or tied areas, and
//!   a shape whose semantics have not been stated and tested must not be
//!   quietly approximated by one of those. Unlike the user-defined holes,
//!   these have a public meaning, and each is rejected for its own stated
//!   reason:
//!     * `contact trace` **not parallel to x or y** (natively; compat
//!       approximates it, issue #157) — see its own entry
//!       above (issue #110: the public description of the diagonal case
//!       does not determine the cell size);
//! * **`contact circle` is rejected by name as well — and it is not a
//!   documented shape at all** (issue #109). The public description of the
//!   `contact` family names the simple refinement utilities `point`,
//!   `line`, `rect` and `decay_rect`, the contact-*area* utility
//!   `equiv_rect`, the grouped `connection` and `trace` built on them, and
//!   the `initial_grid`/`initial_mesh_grid` pair that pre-divides the
//!   plane; `circle` is a **hole** shape (`hole circle (x, y, z, r)`), not
//!   a contact one.
//!   So there is no argument list to pin, nothing in the deck says what a
//!   `contact circle`'s values would mean, and the rejection stands unless
//!   documentation for such a utility surfaces — it is not work awaiting an
//!   implementation here.
//!
//!   The geometry is not what is missing. A disc needs no new shape on this
//!   mesh: a refined x-band spans the plane in y and a y-band spans it in
//!   x, so *any* refinement that covers a disc produces the disc's
//!   bounding-square bands — exactly the argument the diagonal `contact
//!   line` above rests on. `contact decay_rect (x, y, z, 2r, 2r, xcell,
//!   ycell, xmaxcell, ymaxcell)` over that bounding square is therefore the
//!   whole of what a `contact circle` could mean here, at the same cost
//!   (the square's corners are refined too, the disc's `4/π` overhead) —
//!   widen each width by its own cell, as `contact point` pads by half a
//!   cell on each side, to keep the cells grazing the rim fine as well. The
//!   error says exactly that rather than leaving the reader to work it out.
//! * **`file=`** names the plane's nonuniform-discretization *hierarchy*
//!   file — an input, not a dump of the finished mesh — and `file=NONE`
//!   says there is no such file: the hierarchy is a single root cell,
//!   discretized at run time from the statement's own clauses (issue #122).
//!   That is the only case this reader ever has, so `file=NONE` is accepted
//!   as the no-op it is (matched without regard to case) and the documented
//!   `file=NONE contact initial_grid (n1, n2)` spelling reads as written; a
//!   *named* file is rejected by name, as the input this reader does not
//!   read.
//! * **`relx=` / `rely=` / `relz=`** (default 0) are the documented
//!   offset (User's Guide §1.3.9; issue #146): it is added to every
//!   in-plane coordinate the statement carries — each `N<name> (x, y, z)`
//!   node reference, each `hole` shape's points or centre, and each
//!   `contact` clause's points, ends or centre — but **not** to the corner
//!   points `x1…z3`, so the mesh is unchanged while what lands on it moves.
//!   A deck with `relx=0.3` reads exactly as the same deck with those
//!   coordinates written 0.3 larger. Only coordinates move: widths, cell
//!   sizes and radii do not. The keys apply wherever they stand in the
//!   statement (a `relx` after the clauses still moves them), and a
//!   repeated key's last value wins for every point. A `relz` that lifts a
//!   clause out of the plane's slab is the same error it would be written
//!   out. Under [`ParseOptions::fasthenry_compat`], one empty coordinate
//!   field in a node reference (`N1 (, 10.1, 10.1)`) reads as 0 before the
//!   offset, with a warning; natively it is an error, and two empty fields
//!   are an error in both modes.
//! * The remaining documented plane parameters are rejected by name too,
//!   each with the reason and the alternative: `rh` (plane filaments are
//!   uniform) and `segwid1`/`segwid2` (bar widths follow the cells).
//!   Nothing on a `G` statement is silently ignored.
//!
//! # Semantics
//!
//! * **Units are mandatory.** A deck without an explicit `.units` line is
//!   rejected rather than silently assuming a default, so a missing unit can
//!   never scale a result by a factor of 10 or 100. The unit is
//!   case-insensitive: `km` (10³ m), `m`, `cm`, `mm`, `um` (10⁻⁶ m), `in`
//!   (0.0254 m) or `mils` (10⁻³ in; `mil` is a synonym). Lengths
//!   (coordinates, `w`, `h`) scale with the unit; **conductivity and
//!   resistivity are per deck unit** — `sigma=5.8e4` under `.units mm` is
//!   copper (5.8e4 S/mm = 5.8e7 S/m), and so is `rho=1.7241e-5`
//!   (Ω·mm = 1.7241e-8 Ω·m). `rho=r` is exactly `sigma=1/r`.
//! * **`nwinc`/`nhinc` and `rw`/`rh` cut the cross-section into
//!   filaments.** `nwinc` filaments go across the width and `nhinc` across
//!   the height (default 1 each). `rw` and `rh` are the ratio of adjacent
//!   filament extents along the width and the height respectively, each
//!   axis independently: every filament is `rw` (or `rh`) times as wide
//!   (or high) as its neighbour one step nearer the conductor surface, so
//!   the thinnest filaments line both surfaces and the fattest fill the
//!   core — `nwinc=5 rw=2` cuts the width in the proportions 1:2:4:2:1, and
//!   `nwinc=4 rw=3` in 1:3:3:1. This is the library's graded
//!   discretization (`fasterhenry::discretize_graded_per_axis`), per
//!   segment. A ratio must be at least 1 (1 is a uniform axis; a ratio
//!   below 1, coarsening *toward* the surface, is rejected rather than
//!   guessed at), and it has no effect on an axis with a single filament.
//!   **An omitted ratio means a uniform axis** (ratio 1): this reader's
//!   long-standing behaviour, kept so that a deck without `rw`/`rh` solves
//!   exactly as before. Set `rw`/`rh` explicitly (on the segment or in
//!   `.default`) to request a graded grid.
//! * **`wx`/`wy`/`wz` orient the cross-section.** Together they are a
//!   vector along the segment's *width* (dimensionless: it is not scaled by
//!   `.units`, and need be neither normalized nor exactly perpendicular to
//!   the segment — only its component perpendicular to the centreline
//!   counts). The height then runs along `length × width`. As soon as one
//!   component is given (on the segment or in `.default`), the vector is
//!   explicit and any component given nowhere is 0; each component falls
//!   back to its own `.default`. A zero vector, or one parallel to the
//!   segment, fixes no orientation and is an error on the `E` line. Without
//!   any of the three, the default rule applies: the width lies in the x–y
//!   plane, perpendicular to the segment (`+x` for a segment along z) —
//!   see `fasterhenry::Segment::basis`.
//! * **`.freq fmin fmax ndec`** samples `ndec` points per decade,
//!   log-spaced: `f(k) = fmin · 10^(k/ndec)` for `k = 0 … n−1`, with
//!   `n = floor(ndec · log10(fmax/fmin)) + 1`; `fmin` is always the first
//!   point and `fmax` is reached when the decades divide evenly.
//!   `fmin = fmax` (any `ndec`) is the single-frequency case; `fmin = 0` is
//!   allowed only there (the DC solve).
//! * **Node names are case-insensitive** (User's Guide §1.1; issue #156).
//!   Every node name is folded to lowercase before it is matched, so `N3`
//!   declared and `n3` referenced are one node, and declaring `n1` after
//!   `N1` is a duplicate-name error — never two nodes. Names reach output
//!   lowercased (a port's default `<+>/<->` label); an explicit
//!   `.external` label is a label, not a node name, and is kept as written.
//!   There are no forward references: a segment endpoint, `.external` or
//!   `.equiv` naming a node first declared on a later line is an error.
//! * **`.equiv a b …`** joins its nodes: the first name in the list that is
//!   already **defined** is the canonical node, and every other defined
//!   name becomes an alias of it — every reference, made before or after
//!   the directive, resolves to the canonical node, and the aliased nodes
//!   do not appear in the resulting geometry. A name **not yet defined**
//!   becomes a *pseudonym* for the canonical node (User's Guide §1.3.7),
//!   usable from then on as an endpoint or in `.external` like any node
//!   name, wherever it stands in the list; a list with no defined name is
//!   an error, and so is declaring a node under a name that is already a
//!   pseudonym. Naming one node twice (`.equiv x x`, or two names already
//!   joined) is an error, or under [`ParseOptions::fasthenry_compat`] a
//!   [`ParseWarning`] and a no-op. One exception to "the first defined name
//!   wins": if any node in the joined set is an in-plane node, the whole set
//!   lands on that plane (see above), because joining a via's node to a
//!   plane node is what wires a deck into a plane and the result must not
//!   depend on the argument order.
//! * **`.couples` truncates, and defaults to truncating nothing.** Without a
//!   `.couples` line — and with `.couples all` — every pair of conductors is
//!   coupled, exactly as before. A `.couples g1 g2 …` line switches the deck
//!   into truncating mode and declares the listed groups mutually coupled (a
//!   clique: every listed group with every other). Every other pair of groups
//!   has its mutual inductance dropped without ever being computed. Segments
//!   take their group from `group=<name>` on the `E` line (case-sensitive,
//!   unlike node names: it is this reader's own extension, not a FastHenry
//!   name); untagged segments and ground planes share one default
//!   group. Naming a group no segment carries is an error, not a no-op.
//!   Truncation is a physical approximation — see the `fasterhenry::coupling`
//!   module documentation for when it is safe; groups closer than their own
//!   extent are reported on stderr.
//! * **Planes connect by landing**: a segment or port endpoint that lies
//!   within a plane's footprint and depth is snapped to the nearest live
//!   cell-centre node, wiring the segment into the plane mesh. Declare the
//!   plane before or after the segment — the assembly is order-independent.
//!   A landing that is a *pad* rather than a point is a contact **area**
//!   instead: `contact equiv_rect` (or its `contact connection` shorthand)
//!   names a rectangle of the plane, ties every cell inside it to one node,
//!   and lets the deck land on that (see the corner-point form above).
//! * **`.contact` grades the mesh under a landing.** A plane's `nx`/`ny`
//!   are its *background* resolution; every `.contact` rectangle is cut
//!   into `nx × ny` fine cells of its own (default `2 × 2`) and the cells
//!   outside it grow by `ratio` each (default `2`, `1` meaning no decay)
//!   until they reach the background cell. Put one under each via landing
//!   to resolve the current crowding there without paying for a fine mesh
//!   across the whole plane; grading is per axis, so a region refines a
//!   band across the plane in each direction (see the
//!   `fasterhenry::plane` module documentation for the cell-count
//!   formula). `.hole` and `.contact` both name a plane declared earlier
//!   in the deck, with the leading `G` optional.
//! * Everything else is rejected with an error carrying the line number.
//!   Deck-level problems that belong to no single line (missing `.units`, a
//!   ground-plane assembly failure) report line 0; a segment the geometry
//!   rejects is reported on its own `E` line.
